### Introduction
**Hex Party** is a single player Whack-a-mole style game. The 4 x 4 game board displays a randomly generated #hex colour for the player to click or Whack. The game has two levels which adjust the speed of the displayed colours. This was built as my **first project** on the *Web Development Immersive* course at **General Assembly, London** using **JavaScript CSS & HTML**. A hosted version of **Hex Party** can be found [here] (https://immense-castle-12671.herokuapp.com/)
The code can be viewed [here] (https://github.com/brian-cooney/wdi-project-1)

### How to play
Click the start button and choose the game level "Easy or hard" confirm level to start game. A countdown timer is displayed and hex colours will randomly appear on the grid. Click as many as you can before the clock runs out. The body background colour will change each time you click a colour square. The game is built responsive for mobile.   


### Project Brief
1. Create a simple game that puts into practice what we have learned over the past 2 weeks in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
2. Create a 1/2 player game or a computer opponent to beat.
3. The game should ideally be refactored using *object orientated programming* if possible.
